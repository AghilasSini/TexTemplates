Dear Axel Orgogozo and Laurence Deviller,\\

		I am writing to express my interest in the open PhD position titled " Deep Learning for emotion classification in speech ", posted at \url{http://www.anrt.asso.fr/com/imgAdmin/1459332134891.pdf}. I am research engineer with the Multispeech project-team at LORIA laboratory Nancy, France. Pursuing my interest in speech signal processing I have been working with the Multispeech team for more than two years. I believe that this position will be a great opportunity to pursue a PhD in my area of interest. 
		
		At LORIA I have been working in area of Computer-Assisted Spoken Language Learning focusing on French spoken by German learners. my contribution is towards both the signal processing and machine learning aspects including speech feature extraction, speech modification and dynamic programming. Previously, I worked on speech text alignment which introduce me to methods in speech recognition. My master's intern-ship with Emmanuel Vincent and Fran√ßois Charptier, explored audio source localisation by mobile robot.A novel approach based on grid occupancy was proposed, this work got published in IEEE ICASSP 2015 Conference.  This experiences demonstrate my research skills and exposure.
